### TASK

Danny owns a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: Sushi, Curry and Ramen. Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. He has provided us with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for us to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!
